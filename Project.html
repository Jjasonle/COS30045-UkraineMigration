	<h1>Ukraine Migration in Europe</h1>

	<p>The following visualisations are a part of the COS30045 - Data Visualisation major assessment. 
	The purpose of the visualisations is to demonstrate the effects of conflict on migration of Ukrainian refugees
	in Europe from the years 2017 to 2021. All the visualisations are coded in Javascript and D3. By observing the
	visualisations, you'll be able to compare and contrast the patterns of migration across different European
	countries. The data for these visualisations can be found at the 
	<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/MIGR_RESVALID__custom_6035337/default/table?lang=en">eurostat Data Browser</a>.</p>

			<p>The purpose of this visualisation is so we can see the total number of migrants for each country over the three years 
			in order to show which countries are the most popular within the dataset as a whole. This visualisation is also used to 
			depict how much of the data is being contributed from each year using the colour coded stacks that represent each year 
			within the dataset.</p>

			<p>The purpose of this diagram is to clearly show the difference between the magnitude of migrants for each country 
			isolated to a specific year. Showing the data as a percentage within each year allows us to see the popularity of each 
			country based on the year. you can change the diagram to a different year to see how that popularity has changed over time 
			based on the change in Percentage rather than just the overall amounts. </p>
